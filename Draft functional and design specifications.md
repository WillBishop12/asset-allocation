Built-in calculator for different methods of measuring risk and volatility in a stock portfolio
- Difference between risk and volatility

## 2. Probabilistic model of future performance based on past

Time-series / probabilistic model. Say you want to invest for a 20-year timeline. How well do past return and risk measures predict the next 20 years of returns?

Investment companies always tell us "past performance is no guarantee of future results". Can we quantify how uncertain it is?

## 2. Seeing how choice of risk measure affects asset allocation decisions

## 3. Selecting portfolio based on chosen level of risk

## 4. Measuring uncertainty in your strategy

If you had picked a portfolio based on the same criteria 20 years ago, how well would it have done? How certain or uncertain can you be that your strategy is the right one?
